# MI_project

The goal of the project is to study the relationship between co-morbid events observed before and MI and the polygenic risk score, as well as genome-wide significant SNPs

The following scripts have been created:

- `utils.R` - contains functions to use in the analysis (mostly for plotting)
- `post_mi_ana_sensitivity.R` - association between MI and events observed after MI, considering only events after baseline
- `post_mi_ana.R` - association between MI and events observed after MI
- `pre_mi_ana_sensitivity.R` - association between MI and events observed before MI, considering only events after baseline
- `pre_mi_ana.R` - association between MI and events observed before MI
